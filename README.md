# Material UI + Parcel boilerplate

## What is this

Very often I need a boilerplate to sketch out a UI or app idea.

I wanted something very minimal but ready to produce a static React app.

## Changelog

- 28 Dec 2018
  The initial code is from the Material UI parcel example.
  I added an eslintrc but not totally happy about the config.


## How to use

Download the boilerplate [or clone the repo](https://github.com/fibasile/materialui-parcel-boilerplate):

Install it and run:

```sh
npm install
npm run start
```
